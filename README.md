# OOControl
A GUI library for object-oriented <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a> applications, currently in alpha.

# Motivations
* To make GUIs that can be dynamic. That means making GUIS able to cope with translation, rotation, and scaling
* To enable GUI-development using a graphical editor
* To make it easy to nest controllers.
* To make it so controllers talk with each other through explicit interfaces rather than invisible callbacks.

# Roadmap
* Make controllers
* Make Javadocs
* Make demos
* Make editor in which to design GUIs
