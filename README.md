# OOControl
A GUI library for object-oriented Processing applications, currently in alpha.

# Motivations
* To make GUIs that cope with translation, rotation, and scaling
* To design GUIs using a graphical editor
* To make it easy to nest controllers.
* To make it so controllers talk with other code through explicit interfaces rather than invisible callbacks.

# Roadmap
* Make controllers
* Make demos
* Make editor in which to design GUIs
